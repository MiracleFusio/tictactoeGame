you can tap 'node app.js' in commandline to start this game in 3x3 version, if you want to play a endgame, 
just create a .json file.

Step 1: Create a .json file and add {} in the first line.
Step 2: add "board", "playerLetter", "computerLetter" and "computerMoves" in {} as the property.
(Board need to be a perfect square number in length like 9, 16, 25.
 Keep in mind that there are only two letter as the sign: 'X' and 'O', and the player with 'X' will go first.
 computerMoves is a array that shows what the computer will add sign at)
